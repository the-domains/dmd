_What does a follower of Jesus look like today? How do we make and apprentice disciples as we go about life? How do we catalyze and mobilize our churches and groups for the mission of God today?_

Our theme this year is: **Be•Make•Send Disciples | **_**In New Zealand as it is in Heaven**_

God's will is predetermined. His mind is fixed upon his purposes and plans and we want to be disciples that bring about his will here on Earth as it is in Heaven. We want to be disciples who reflect the ways of Jesus in everything we do, everywhere we are, for life.

From 5-6 November, the third annual Disciples Making Disciples Conference is hosted Tauranga at the Otumoetai Church of Christ!
