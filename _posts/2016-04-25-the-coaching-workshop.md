**_**"Integrate Coaching skills into your Leadership and Disciple-Making"**_**

**WHAT IS THE COACHING WORKSHOP?**

Coaching is not a new program for your church or another thing to add to your already busy schedule. It is an approach to doing ministry. It is a way of leading and equipping others in their walk with God.

Coaching skills will increase your effectiveness in your various ministry and leadership roles. People who take this workshop see significant advancements in their ministry impact, while seeing their stress and busy-ness go down.

It is not just the basics. Based on the book, The COACH Model for Christian Leaders, this workshop is made for those who are experienced as well as those who are not-so-experienced in coaching skills.

You can learn more about what Christian Coaching is at this [link][1].

After the 3-day intensive workshop you will be able to:

* Listen actively so others feel you understand them.
