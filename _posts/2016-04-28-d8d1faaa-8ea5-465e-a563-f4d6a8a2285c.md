  The overall purpose of the DMD is to reignite passion, focus, and explore how
  we can partner together in our eternal purpose. This will be done through
  prayer, study of the word, reflection of the past and present, and finally
  dreaming and strategising for the future. Our desire as servant leaders is
  simply to obey Jesus and see the multiplication of Christ-followers in New
  Zealand and beyond.
