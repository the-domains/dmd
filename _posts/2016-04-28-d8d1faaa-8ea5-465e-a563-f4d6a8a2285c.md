The overall purpose of the DMD is to reignite passion, focus, and explore how we can partner together in our eternal purpose. This will be done through prayer, study of the word, reflection of the past and present, and finally dreaming and strategizing for the future. Our desire as servant leaders is simply to obey Jesus and see the multiplication of Christ-followers in New Zealand and beyond.
